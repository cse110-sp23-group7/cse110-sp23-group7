## Standup
### JUnit Testing Team: Ankit, Nishant, Steven
- Ankit, Nishant and Steven debugged the tests that they have not and pushed their changes
- Tests are working on the client side though not on the CI/CD pipeline for some reason

### Design and Frontend Team: Matthew and Anukul
- Lots of progress on frontend by using placeholder designs
- Waiting on Eddie's graphics in order to use them
- Planning on pushing the final frontend with the intended design asap

### CI/CD Pipeline: Raj and Mary
- CI/CD Pipeline is fully functional => whenever you make a pull request, the pipeline will run and perform linting, code quality checks, tests, and documentation generation
- Documentation is in specs/doc

### Additional Notes
- Biggest priority is reaching out to Eddie and Ada to get more information on design and development
- Fill out When2Meet ASAP for the interview.
